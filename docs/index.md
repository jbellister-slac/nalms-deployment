# NALMS Deployment

The [NALMS deployment](https://github.com/slaclab/nalms-deployment) GitHub repository is the location where files for deploying accelerator-side alarm
applications are stored. It handles workflows for both the alarm configuration CSV files, as well as the Kubernetes 
deployment manifest files. Currently both the cryoplant and the LCLS accelerator alarm delpoyments are managed 
from here.
